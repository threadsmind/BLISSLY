# BLISSLY

BLISSLY is a music generation tool that runs on the [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) framework. The goal of BLISSLY is to create an app that creates calming or blissful music. It was originally meant be a study or work aid.

## Known Issues

The minified/uglified build of BLISSLY may not function properly in newer versions of Firefox. There is a separate build for Firefox in `/firefox/` that should work while this issue is solved.
