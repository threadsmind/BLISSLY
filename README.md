# BLISSLY

BLISSLY is a music generation tool that runs on the [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) framework. The goal of BLISSLY is to create an app that creates calming or blissful music. It was originally meant be a study or work aid.

## BLISSLY Demo

You can test out BLISSLY on the [BLISSLY itch.io page](https://brandonmakesthings.itch.io/blissly). This demo is usually kept up-to-date with the master branch.

## Headless Mode

BLISSLY can be run in headless mode by passing `false` as the first argument of `Blissly.init()`. With this mode you should be able to include BLISSLY in any webpage, web app, or browser-based game.

Example: `Blissly.init(false);`

## Known Issues

The minified/uglified build of BLISSLY may not function properly in newer versions of Firefox. There is a separate build for Firefox in `/firefox/` that should work while this issue is solved.

You can try a password-protected demo of the Firefox build on the [BLISSLY-Firefox itch.io page](https://brandonmakesthings.itch.io/blissly-firefox) using the password "BLISSLY". This demo is not maintained.
